The dataset used in this report is flight fare data in India in 2019 "Flight Fare Prediction" The purpose or target of this dataset is to analyze data and build a prediction model that can predict airplane ticket prices based on these features. By using 3 models namely K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Decision Tree Regression. And at the evaluation stage using 3 metrics namely R2_Score, MAE, and MSE. From the evaluation results it was found that the best model for this dataset was Random Forest Regression with R2_score training > 94% and test > 82% so it has good fit results.
